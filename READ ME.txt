Working demo LP's are included in the 
DemoLPs file.

I've noticed problems with the following:
*Infeasible LP's

I've not been able to:
*Program a way to identify unbounded LP's
*alter the program to work correctly with 
 sign restrictions other than x,y>0 although
 i can program asymptotes for either - +
 or URS.

The program does the following well:
*Solve min and max LP's in the 
 first quadrant.
*Solve LP's with multiple solutions
*Display an alternative ISO profit
 line based on C1 and C2 as entered
 by the user.
